# Water-Tank-Monitor
Sonar water tank level monitor using a Raspberry Pi 2 Zero

This is a websocket server to monitor the water level in a tank using an ultrasonic sensor.

The sensor runs in serial mode & samples the tank level at 10Hz, the websocket server streams an average value at 1Hz.

Its written in Perl, which was a great language if you wrote webpages (in the 90's) - but also just happens to be my favourite language for simple things.

Enjoy.
